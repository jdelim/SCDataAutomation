This project automates the data insertion process into the STEAM:CODERS database in Snowflake using [Snowflake's Python Connector API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/snowflake-python-connecting-snowflake).  
User, password, and account details can be found in your Snowflake Account Details > Config File.
Make sure to create your own venv and then install the necessary dependencies on requirements.txt.
